In April 2022, I attended the virtual British Gravity (BritGrav) conference where I was lucky to be given the opportunity to present my recent paper Searches for Gravitational Waves from Known Pulsars at Two Harmonics in the Second and Third LIGO-Virgo Observing Runs (see [my post on it here](https://alhewitt.github.io/publications/o3-known-pulsar-paper/) and a link to [full paper here](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...935....1A/abstract)).
