# Searching for gravitational waves from pulsars.

The aim of my PhD project at Lancaster University is to investigate evidence for and hopefully observe [gravitational waves](_posts/2022-08-28-gravitational-waves.md) emitted from [pulsars](_posts/2022-08-28-pulsars.md).

  - Braking index project

## Workshops
  - Astrostatistics (Online)

## Conferences
  - BritGrav 2022 (Online)
  - EAS 2022 (Valencia)
  - NAM 2022 (Coventry)
