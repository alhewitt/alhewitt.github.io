The aim of my PhD project at Lancaster University is to investigate evidence for - and hopefully observe - [gravitational waves](https://alhewitt.github.io/overviews/gravitational-waves/) emitted from [pulsars](https://alhewitt.github.io/overviews/pulsars/). 

## Projects

  - Braking index project

## Workshops
  - Astrostatistics (Online)

## Conferences
{% include gallery id="conferences_gallery" type="center" %}
  - NAM 2022 (Coventry)

## Other
 - Observing run at Isacc Newton Telescope (INT), La Palma
