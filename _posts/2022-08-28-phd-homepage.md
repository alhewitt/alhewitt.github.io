The aim of my PhD project at Lancaster University is to investigate evidence for - and hopefully observe - [gravitational waves](https://alhewitt.github.io/overviews/gravitational-waves/) emitted from [pulsars](https://alhewitt.github.io/overviews/pulsars/). 

## Projects
  - [Known pulsar paper](https://alhewitt.github.io/publications/o3-known-pulsar-paper/) (Searches for Gravitational Waves from Known Pulsars at Two Harmonics in the Second and Third LIGO-Virgo Observing Runs)
  - Braking index project

## Workshops
  - Astrostatistics (Online)

## Conferences
  - BritGrav 2022 (Online)
  - [EAS 2022 (Valencia)](https://alhewitt.github.io/presentations/eas2022/)
  - NAM 2022 (Coventry)

## Other
