# Searching for gravitational waves from pulsars.

The aim of my PhD project at Lancaster University is to investigate evidence for and hopefully observe [graviatational waves](gravitational-waves.md) emitted from [pulsars](pulsars.md). 

## Projects
  - [Known pulsar paper](known-pulsar-paper.md) (Searches for Gravitational Waves from Known Pulsars at Two Harmonics in the Second and Third LIGO-Virgo Observing Runs)
  - Braking index project

## Workshops
  - Astrostatistics (Online)

## Conferences
  - BritGrav 2022 (Online)
  - EAS 2022 (Valencia)
  - NAM 2022 (Coventry)
