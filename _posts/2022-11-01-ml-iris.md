My first project is supposedly the "Hello World!" of machine learning. Following the walkthrough [here](https://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-in-python-step-by-step/), I trained several algorithms on a dataset containing Iris flower characteristic and species using stratified 10-fold cross validation. Then, the best algorithm (chosen using precision) was tested using a 20% slice of the original dataset which had been withheld from it during training. The result is the SVM (Support Vector Machines) algorithm with an accuracy of 0.97.
