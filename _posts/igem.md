## TL;DR
In the summer between my 2nd and 3rd years at Exeter, I took part in an internatational synthetic biology competition called iGEM (international Genetically Engineered Machines). This annual competition pits university (and some high school) teams against each other as they try to make the world a better place using genetic engineering. Alone with 10 other students, I helped conceptualise, design and test a bioreactor capable of turning the chemical perchlorate found in Martian soil into breathable oxygen. I also helped design and make a couple of [pages](http://2018.igem.org/Team:Exeter/HP/Bioreactor) on the [Exeter iGEM 2018](http://2018.igem.org/Team:Exeter/Description) website.

## Motivation
Do I need more motivation to go to Mars than just that it would be awesome? Well, I'll give you some anyway. It is human nature to be curious. We were driven to walk on the Moon and that same drive pushes us today to test humankind's limits and step foot on another planet. Mars is the obvious candidate for a first attempt. It's close, solid, and doesn't have an atmosphere which will corrode your space-craft. It's only a matter of time before we get there. The question now is: what do we do once we get there? Well, anybody who arrives on Mars will probably need to breathe oxygen. Unfortunately there isn't a whole lot of that on Mars and every gram counts when launching a rocket so bringing tanks of it with us is less than ideal. Whether we're there for exploration, science or because we've already destroyed our beautiful home planet, we'll need to find a way of generating oxygen if we're to survive very long.

## Solution
Martian soil (more formally known as regolith) contains an abundance of a chemical called perchlorate. This is toxic to humans and therefore would need to be removed from any soil destined for agriculture. Perchlorate can also be reduced into oxygen using a two-step reaction via chlorite as seen below:

$$
\text{ClO}_4^-+2\text{AH}_2\xrightarrow{\text{PcrABCD}}\text{ClO}_2^-+2\text{H}_2\text{O}
$$

Reduction of perchlorate into chlorite.

$$
\text{ClO}_2^-\xrightarrow{\text{Cld}}\text{Cl}^-+\text{O}_2
$$

Reduction of chlorite into oxygen.

This it really very convenient! We can design a bioreactor with two-fold applications.
 1. It can remove toxic perchlorate from Martian soil
 2. It can break down that perchlorate into breatheable oxygen

Now all we have to do is design it.

## Bioreactor

The full design process for this bioreactor is documented [here](http://2018.igem.org/Team:Exeter/HP/Bioreactor) so I will give the abridged version.
