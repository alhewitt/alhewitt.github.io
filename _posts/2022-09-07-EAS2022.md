In June 2022 I travelled to Valencia, Spain to attend the European Astronomical Society (EAS) 2022 meeting. There, I was given the opportunity to present my recent paper, Searches for Gravitational Waves from Known Pulsars at Two Harmonics in the Second and Third LIGO-Virgo Observing Runs (see [my post on it here](https://alhewitt.github.io/publications/o3-known-pulsar-paper/) and a link to [full paper here](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...935....1A/abstract)).
