## TL;DR
In the summer between my 2nd and 3rd years at Exeter, I took part in an internatational synthetic biology competition called iGEM (international Genetically Engineered Machines). This annual competition pits university (and some high school) teams against each other as they try to make the world a better place using genetic engineering. Alone with 10 other students, I helped conceptualise, design and test a bioreactor capable of turning the chemical perchlorate found in Martian soil into breathable oxygen. I also helped design and make a couple of [pages](http://2018.igem.org/Team:Exeter/HP/Bioreactor) on the [Exeter iGEM 2018](http://2018.igem.org/Team:Exeter/Description) website.
