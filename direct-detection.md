# Direct Detection of Solar Angular Momentum Loss with the Wind Spacecraft

## TL;DR

I was lucky to be given the opportunity to work with [AWESoME Stars](https://empslocal.ex.ac.uk/AWESoMeStars/) at the University of Exeter during the summer between my 3rd and 4th years there. I worked under Prof. Sean Matt and Dr. Adam Finley to obtain a direct measurement of the angular momentum loss rate of the Sun using data from the *Wind* spacecraft. My specific role was to analyse the data to produce the measurement with guidance from the others on the team. The results were written up by Adam and published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters as [*Direct Detection of Solar Angular Momentum Loss with the Wind Spacecraft*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10177).

## Introduction

The Sun is the closest star to us, the only one whose stellar wind is directly measurable. Our knowledge of our star is used as a reference for how we expect other stars in the universe to behave. It is difficult to understand a process in other stars if it is not first understood in the Sun.

The solar wind is an example of something which is not completely understood. It is a stream of charged particles, consisting mostly of protons and electrons from the ionisation of hydrogen, and alpha particles from the ionisation of helium during fusion within the Sun. This wind doesn't travel at one average speed, rather it travels in one of two types of stream; fast and slow. Slow wind is not fully understood, but it is known that it has conditions resembling those at the Sun's corona with an average speed of 400 kms$$^{-1}$$, and originates from areas of the Sun with closed magnetic field lines. The fast wind is better understood, at an average speed of 700 kms$$^{-1}$$. Its conditions match those of the Sun's photosphere, and it originates from coronal holes and areas of open flux. Through the solar wind, the Sun loses approximately 10$$^{12}$$ gs$$^{-1}$$, and this mass carries with it angular momentum.

Over the lifetime of a star, its rotation about its axis will change significantly. During periods of contraction, such as during its formation, conservation of angular momentum causes the rotation to speed up. While on the main sequence however, angular momentum can be lost due to particles in the stellar wind carrying angular momentum away from the Sun, as well as stresses in its own magnetic field applying a torque. 

Multiple methods of estimating the angular momentum loss of the Sun use models to predict a value. Each method yields a different result. Without an experimental value to work towards, it is impossible to know which of these models is the most accurate.

This project aims to produce a value for the rate at which the Sun is losing angular momentum.
