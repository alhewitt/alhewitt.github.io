# Modelling interacting galaxies

This project aimed to model a new system of interacting galaxies by writing a suitable N-body code in Python. This model would then be analysed and compared to observed features in the galaxy system. Two codes were written, one using a Barnes-Hut algorithm to model galaxies containing live Navarro–Frenk–White (NFW) dark matter halos, and another to simulate them using NFW halo potentials and a model for dynamical friction. The Arp 240 system was modelled and a best fit interaction was found with a pericentre of 37.7 kpc, 0.22 Gyrs ago which was in agreement with expected and literature values. A visual comparison between the simulation and observations showed many similarities, such as a spiral structure, bar, counterarms, and a tail. However, more detailed comparisons between the two codes and the literature found inconsistencies, such as a line of sight velocity 28.3 times larger than observed, so the reliability of the simulations is questioned.
